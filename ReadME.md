## Description
This project provides an API and a Streamlit application for predicting power output 
(PE) based on environmental factors. 
The model uses Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn, 
trained on features including:

- Ambient Temperature (AT)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V)
- Ambient Pressure (AP)
- Relative Humidity (RH)


# The API is deployed using FastAPI, and a Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to input values and get predictions.

## Requirements
To set up and run this project, youâ€™ll need the following Python packages:

- 'fastapi'
- 'uvicorn'
- 'scikit-learn'
- 'pandas'
- 'joblib'
- 'numpy'
- 'streamlit'

You can install these dependencies by running:

'''bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

1. Train and Save Model

    Train a Linear Regression modeling using scikit-learn, and save the trained model to a file for deployment:
  '''bash
  python linear_regression_model.py
  '''
